Combine Milk and Corn Starch in a heat-proof bowl and mix very well. Cook in the microwave in medium power. Cooking time depends on your machine. I set my machine at 600W, cook 90 seconds, STIR UP very well, then cook 30 seconds and STIR!
The gooey paste will turn firmer and rubbery like ‘Mochi’ when cold. Enjoy warm or cold, with your favourite topping.
